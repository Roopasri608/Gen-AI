# Gen-Ai-Workshop

## GenAI Workshop – Google Colab Edition
Welcome to the Generative AI Workshop – an interactive, beginner-friendly session designed to introduce you to the core principles of GenAI using Google Colab. Whether you're a student, developer, or enthusiast, this notebook will help you gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI tools and concepts.

## Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

Understand what Generative AI is and how it differs from traditional AI.

Experiment with prompt engineering to guide LLM responses.

Explore embeddings and semantic search using vector representations.

Utilize FAISS for efficient similarity search.

Build a basic question-answering system using a PDF as input.

Gain awareness of the tools (like LangChain, OpenAI API) powering modern GenAI solutions.

 ## Workshop Highlights
Intro to LLMs – What are large language models and how do they work?

Prompt Engineering – Learn how to write effective prompts.

Embeddings – Convert text to vectors for semantic understanding.

Vector Store (FAISS) – Search your own documents like a chatbot.

LangChain Basics – How to build simple pipelines with modular components.

PDF Q&A Bot – Upload a PDF and ask questions about its content.

## Skills You’ll Learn
Prompt design & tuning

Semantic similarity

Document retrieval using vector stores

LangChain pipelines for real-world AI apps

Deploying GenAI logic in Colab

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Python

A Google account to run the Colab notebook
